            Welcome! I'm Youssef. I'm a 13-year-old aspiring creator with a
            passion for videography, photography, and web development. I’ve
            recently started exploring video editing using CapCut, and I’m
            really enjoying the creative process. I'm also learning how to code,
            focusing on building websites and understanding how the web works.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and
            constantly learning new skills. This is my first official website —
            thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring it!

            <h4>my favourit sport</h4>
            <h3>football</h3>
            <p>
              My favorite sport is football because it's exciting, fast-paced,
              and brings people together. I’m especially inspired by Cristiano
              Ronaldo, who I consider the GOAT (Greatest of All Time). His
              dedication, skill, and incredible achievements motivate me to work
              hard and never give up. My favorite team is Real Madrid because of
              their strong history, amazing players, and the passion they bring
              to every match. Watching them play, especially when Ronaldo was
              part of the team, made me love football even more.

            <h4>my favorite game</h4>
            <h3>the finals</h3>
            <p>
              My favorite game is The Finals because it's action-packed,
              intense, and full of strategy. I love how every match feels
              different, with fast-paced gameplay and exciting teamwork. The
              graphics are amazing, and the destruction mechanics make it even
              more fun and realistic. I enjoy competing with others, improving
              my skills, and trying out different playstyles. *The Finals*
              always keeps me on my toes, which is why it’s the game I enjoy the
              most.

            <h4>my favourit movie</h4>
            <h3>smile</h3>
            <p>
              My favorite movie is *Smile* because it’s scary, thrilling, and
              keeps me on the edge of my seat. I like how the story slowly
              builds tension and surprises you with creepy moments. The way the
              characters deal with fear and the mysterious curse makes it really
              interesting to watch. It’s not just about jump scares—it has a
              deep and creepy storyline that sticks with you. That’s why *Smile*
              is the movie I enjoy the most.

            <h3>ransom</h3>
            <p>
              My favorite song is *Ransom* because it has a catchy beat and a
              cool vibe that always gets me hyped. I like the way Lil Tecca raps
              with confidence and smooth flow, and the lyrics are fun to sing
              along to. The energy of the song makes it perfect for any mood,
              whether I’m chilling or trying to get pumped up. It’s the kind of
              song that never gets old, which is why *Ransom* is my favorite.

          <h3>lycée voltaire</h3>
          <p>
            My school is called Lycée Voltaire, and it's a place where I learn,
            grow, and spend time with my friends. The teachers are helpful and
            always try to make the lessons interesting and fun. The school has a
            nice environment that makes it easy to focus and do my best every
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the things I like most about Lycée Voltaire is the variety of
            subjects we study. From math and science to languages and art,
            there’s always something new to learn. The school also has fun
            activities and events that make the school year exciting and
            enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy the time I spend with my classmates at Lycée Voltaire.
            We work together, help each other, and share a lot of good memories.
            It’s more than just a school—it feels like a second home where I’m
            supported and encouraged to be my best.
